# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- My motivation in undergoing this project was to get a base understanding of the basics of web development.
- I built this project to help explore the fundamentals of web development in a more hands on manner.
- This project allows me to learn directly by interacting and manipulating the code as I learn the structure of each language and their purposes.
- I learned the basics of CSS,HTML, Git, and JavaScript and how they all fit within a workflow to create a web application.
